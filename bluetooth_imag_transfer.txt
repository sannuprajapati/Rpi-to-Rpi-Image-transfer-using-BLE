------------transfer image from one raspbery pi to another------------------

my pi : B8:27:EB:7D:E2:B9
basant sir  pi : B8:27:EB:B9:D6:80
laptop: 5c:ea:1d:60:77:82

RaspberryPi :192.168.0.63
B8:27:EB:7D:E2:B9

RaspberryPi :192.168.0.53
B8:27:EB:99:74:92




step 1: make RPi decoverable pair up to raspberry pair
-use bluetoothctl tool to connect to raspberry pi via bluetooth



----------------Bluetoothctl commands-----------------------------------------
power on
bluetoothctl
power on

# Make sure an agent is running for the Bluetooth device.
agent on

# Start a scan for other Bluetooth devices in the area.
scan on

# Wait for the required Bluetooth device to be reported...

# Stop scanning when the required Bluetooth device is found.
scan off

# Attempt to pair the required Bluetooth device.
pair <dev>

e.g. <dev>=00:1D:A5:F7:FF:0D

# Pairing normally prompts for a password. Standard Bluetooth pairing passwords
# are: 0000 or 1234, try these if you are unsure of the password.

# If pairing fails or propt for password does not appear, try the following, and
# then try paring again.
agent off
power off
power on
agent on

# Once paired it should appear in the list of paired devices.
paired-devices

# You can now leave the Bluetooth utility and the device should be paired and
# ready for use.
quit



--------------------1) hcitool commands---------------------------------------------------
hcitool scan

//to get information about blutooth controller
hciconfig -a 

//to change name of bluetooth controller at raspberry pi
sudo hciconfig hci0 name <name-to-give>


---------------------2) sdptool-------------------------------------------------

#1st putty session which is running Bluetoothctl.

#Open the second RPi putty session.
sudo sdptool browse XXXXXXXXXXX

# check channel number of obexftp service


----------------------3) rfcomm server-----------------------------

rfcomm0 {
	# Automatically bind the device at startup
 	bind yes;

	# Bluetooth address of the device
	device 50:56:63:A6:5E:06;

	# RFCOMM channel for the connection
	channel	16;

 	# Description of the connection
	comment "OBEX File Transfer";
}


#Ok, now that SPP is running on both boards, we can begin setting up our connection.

#Step 5: Create server and client.

#You can quickly test whether the boards accept a connection by running

sudo rfcomm watch hci0

on one board and then after that (do this on the other board)

sudo rfcomm connect hci0 <bdaddr>
where <bdaddr> is the address of the board 'watching'. If all goes well, on the server (1st) board you should see

Waiting for connection on channel 1
Connection from B8:27:EB:25:95:F5 to /dev/rfcomm0
Press CTRL-C for hangup
And on the client board you should see

Connected to /dev/rfcomm0 to B8:27:EB:7B:F3:62 on channel 1
Press CTRL-C for hangup





#---------------------------------4) OBEX ftp-------------------------------
----on (2nd )putty terminal
sudo obexftp -b XXXXXXXX (laptop address) -c / -l


sudo obexftp -b AC:B5:7D:E2:52:CD -c / -g IMG_20170731_111503.jpg

#to veryfy
ls-l


#To upload, use the following syntax
obexftp -b AC:B5:7D:E2:52:CD -c / -p file.jpg
